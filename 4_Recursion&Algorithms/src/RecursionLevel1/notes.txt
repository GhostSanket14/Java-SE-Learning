As long as a function is not completely executed it will remain in Stack memory.
Main is the First function to be executed and last one to be popped out of the stack.

Why Recursion: It help us to solve bigger problems, by breaking them up into smaller problems.
Space complexity is not constant. So you have to figure out when to use recursion and
when to use iteration.

IMP- Use recursive tree to visually figure out the problem.
Hint to recursion- try to see if there is a smaller version of the problem.

When we write recursion in formula it is called recurrence relation.

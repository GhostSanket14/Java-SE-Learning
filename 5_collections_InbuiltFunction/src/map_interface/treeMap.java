		// Here it also follow same concept. Just for keys and key-value Entries.
		// higherKeys() and lowerKeys()
		// ceilingKeys() and floowKeys()
		// higherEntry() and lowerEntry() , also make sure to use .getValue() if u want to get the value.
		// ceilingEntry() and floowEntry()
		
		// Eg- ___.higherEntry(__).getValue();
		
		// firstKey()	Returns the first(lowest) key currently in this sorted map.
		// lastKey()	Returns the last(highest) key currently in this sorted map.

1. LL Good memory utilization compared to AL, since AL creates new array in which it has empty area. LL has no empty area
   Same reason why deletion is better in LL. after deletion we have to either recopy the array or leave empty spot
2. Data access is slow, as we have to traverse LL. But AL has index hence fast access.
3. Fast insertion as we dont to grow and recopy unlike array. Hence AL have slow insertion.

 I think its enough to give idea. Bye Bye.
